CSS Specific for Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer may be the worst browser for front-end developers. Now I’m working in a pure front-end team and members here spent half of their “styling” time on IE compatibilities. I also heard one Australian online shopping website charges IE users more tax when purchasing their goods, because they waste developers’ time. Coming back, we still need to struggle with IE issues, so here are three basic ways to specify CSS only for IE, which won’t affect other browers badly. I’m not going to introduce why CSS in IE behave differently and how to solve them.

#1 IE condition comments
IE condition comments are readable by IE and can be targeting on different version of IE.

Here [if lt IE 8 ] means targeting IE 8 and below, [if gte IE 8 ] means greater than or equal.

#2 Conditional HTML class
This is mostly widely used in our team. Similarly using IE condition comments, but on HTML body rather than CSS reference in head:

Therefore in CSS file you can use .ie div for IE specific CSS.

#3 IE specific CSS rules.

The most tricky one, this is using CSS rules which can only be understood by IE (and also version specified). Here are sample code:

Comprehensively, “\9″ for IE 8, “*” for IE 7 and “_” for IE 6.
